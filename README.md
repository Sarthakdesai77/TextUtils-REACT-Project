Hello everyone,
Today I am glad to share that I have successfully created my first Single Page Application (𝐒𝐏𝐀) using #reactjs framework, 𝐓𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐔𝐭𝐢𝐥𝐬.
𝐓𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐔𝐭𝐢𝐥𝐬 is a text utility app which has following features which you can use to manipulate your 𝒕𝒆𝒙𝒕𝒔
-         Convert text from Lowercase to Uppercase
-         Convert text from Uppercase to Lowercase
-         Capitalize
-         Sentencecase
-         Clear
-         Character Counter
-         Word Counter
And 𝒎𝒂𝒏𝒚 𝒎𝒐𝒓𝒆 features (utilities) are on the way, I’m working on this App to make this App so useful.
TextUtils App has Dark Mode and fully responsive as I have created this app with bootstrap.

𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 in the Whole Journey:
Firstly, I get to know about building a single page application using react framework. How to use npm, npx

I also get to know about
-  “Passing elements from one page to another” using 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐬, also how to set default props and types of props.
-   How to use Router in react as “𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘵 𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘥𝘰𝘮”
-  How to navigate to other pages without reloading the page using “𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒌 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒕𝒐 𝒕𝒂𝒈” with help of 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘵 𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘳
-  How to add Dark Mode and how to change content according to the theme using ‘’𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘚𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘦’’ method
-  How to handle operation when users click or hover on any element
-  How to 𝒃𝒖𝒊𝒍𝒅 app for production, github-pages.
-  How to use 𝘣𝘰𝘰𝘵𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘱 𝘪𝘯 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘵 by changing some tag like 𝒄𝒍𝒂𝒔𝒔 tag in 𝘣𝘰𝘰𝘵𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘱 changed to 𝒄𝒍𝒂𝒔𝒔𝑵𝒂𝒎𝒆 in 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘵, 𝒇𝒐𝒓 in 𝘣𝘰𝘰𝘵𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘢𝘱 will become 𝒉𝒕𝒎𝒍𝑭𝒐𝒓 in 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘵 and many more.
-  A little bit about 𝑺𝑬𝑶

#𝐓𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐔𝐭𝐢𝐥𝐬 is a word counter, a character counter utility app which can be used to manipulate texts according to your needs. You can easily convert lowercase to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase, also you can Capitalize and you can change to Sentencecase.
